Write a C program that prints <strong>Hello World</strong> without including any header file.

<em>Conceptually it's seems impractical to write a C program that print <strong>Hello World</strong> without using a header file of "stdio.h". Since the definition of printf() function contains in the "stdio.h" header file.</em>

	But we can easily achieve this by taking the advantage of C pre-processor directives. The fact is at the time of compiling a program, the first phase of C preprocessing expands all header files into a single file and after that compiler itself compiles the expanded file. Therefore we just need to extract the definition of printf() function from header file and use it in our main program like that:-

[sourcecode language="C" highlight="2"]
//Declare the definition of printf() function
int printf(const char *format, ...);

int main()
{
  printf( "Hello World" );
  return 0;
}
[/sourcecode]
<pre><strong>Output:</strong> Hello World</pre></li>
